## Description

CPU Dasher for Android is a sophisticated app that contains over 300,000 lines of assembly code and over 60,000 C code to provide nice user experience, accurate CPU frequency and the best CPU performance, without any memory leak or crash. It contains no 3rd party libraries, no ads, no file-writing operations. It does not connect to the network. It provides pure and green functionalities so that it is safe and energy efficient.

It is a smart app that shows a lot of information about ARMv7, ARMv8, x86-64 architecture-basded processors. It lists the device info, CPU info, almost all the instruction set(including general-purpose instructions and SIMD & VFP instructions) and the performance of several common algorithms, such as matrix multiplication, sum of an array, color-to-gray image processing algorithm and image convolution algorithm.
